# RGB-Color-Guessing-Game

The Game has been developed iteratively by first developing the HTML skeleton for heading, buttons and squares. The logic was the implemented in JavaScript by first generating random RGB colors using the Math.random function. Colors were then assigned to the squares and the users clicks were tested against a random picked color. The squares were removed in case of wrong attempts and the game was won by clicking the correct square which changed the color of the main banner and all the squares. The HTML elements were selected by their id or tags to change their text content or add interactivity using Event Listeners.
Once the logic was implemented, CSS was added to modify fonts, add transition to squares and aesthetically improving the game.
